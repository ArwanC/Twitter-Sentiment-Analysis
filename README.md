# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

In this project, we observe the evolution of sentiments (positive/negative) in tweets we gathered, tagged with terms reffering to the Black Lives Matter movement between 29-12-2019 and 20-10-2020. The aim of this work is to portray the effect of events happening during this period and share our results, as well as get accustomed to text preprocessing and sentiment classification.
